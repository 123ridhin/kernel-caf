# Kernel Automation 2.0 #

### What is this ? ###

 This, is is a redo of [this](https://github.com/Area69Lab/kernel-automation) as we find out that the old one sometimes doesn't support all kernels.
 
 Therefore this is a updated, more pro version of the previous one.
 
 This will also have a higher chance to be maintained.
 
 ### How to use this ###
 
 It's quite easy, simple instructions, quick success.
 
 1. Fork this repo to your own account / organization.
 
 2. This is the hardest step, but after this step, everything is easy like cake.
 
 Here, you'd want to update some values in .github/workflows/Caf.yml and script.sh
 
 Check what you want to edit [***here***](https://github.com/Area69Lab/kernel-caf/blob/master/values.md)
 
 3. Enable workflows at action tab, and star your forked repo.
 
 4. Watch the magic begin !
